# Steam Video Game Recommendation System

A Recommendation System developed using Python for Video Games Search on Steam Platform. This project uses the 'difflib' library and 'Cosine Similarity' algorithm to provide recommendations to users based on their search criteria.

The 'difflib' library helps find the closest video game match from the list of all the video games available on Steam platform based on the user's input. This helps identify relevant data from the large pool of games data. Then, the 'Cosine Similarity' algorithm provides results based on the search criteria, after ranking them based on their attributes similarity.
